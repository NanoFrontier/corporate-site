## Background of J-StarX Local to Global Success Selection

NanoFrontier is a chemical deep tech company established in April 2025 as a Tohoku University spin-off. Based on organic nanoparticle technology cultivated at the university for over 30 years, the company has developed laboratory-level techniques into industrially applicable, continuous, and scalable processes.

One of the key areas of focus is PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) detection technology. NanoFrontier has developed a simple detection reagent that instantly visualizes the presence of PFAS through color change by simply adding the reagent to water. This technology, which doesn't require large equipment or specialized skills, has garnered significant interest from many companies as the world's only instant detection approach.

Particularly in the United States, where federal and state PFAS regulations are rapidly strengthening, the demand for water quality monitoring is exploding. The company has positioned the U.S. market as its top priority and has joined this program to initiate full-scale business expansion.

### Future Initiatives

Through participation in the J-StarX Local to Global Success program, NanoFrontier will prioritize commercialization and scaling of its university-originated deep tech organic nanoparticle technology in the U.S. market.

In the short term, focusing on PFAS instant detection reagents, the company will intensively pursue:

- Proof of Concept (PoC) in the United States
- Customer validation with local municipalities, water treatment operators, and environmental consultants
- Establishment of sales and distribution partnerships
- Compliance with U.S. regulations and certifications (e.g., EPA standards)

The goal is to achieve early commercialization in the North American market.

Simultaneously, the company will expand into Asian markets, including Taiwan, to build a global business foundation with the U.S. as a hub. In the medium to long term, NanoFrontier will extend beyond PFAS detection technology to create global businesses in multiple fields, including environmental measurement materials, energy materials, and immersion cooling applications. Furthermore, the company will work towards establishing sustainable business scale and international standard technologies through overseas joint research, technology licensing, and local production systems.

NanoFrontier will accelerate its growth as a global deep tech company, expanding from Japan-based fundamental research to the world market, starting with the United States.

### CEO Comment

"We view this selection as a major turning point for fully expanding our technology into the global market, especially the U.S., where regulatory tightening and market expansion are progressing simultaneously. Armed with organic nanoparticle technology, including PFAS detection, we aim to establish global standard environmental solutions starting from the U.S. and contribute to solving global water quality and environmental challenges."

(Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
