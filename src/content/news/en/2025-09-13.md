# NanoFrontier, a Tohoku University–born startup, launches mass-production and stable-supply initiative for organic nano-dyes that enable low-cost, real-time detection of targeted PFAS under Japan's Go-Tech Program

**Sendai, Miyagi, Japan — September 13, 2025** — **NanoFrontier Inc.** (Head Office: Sendai, Miyagi; CEO: Seiya Inoue) today announced its selection for Japan's **R&D Support Program for Growth-Oriented SMEs (Go-Tech Program)** administered by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency (SMEA). Under this program, NanoFrontier is moving into full execution to establish mass production and a stable, field-ready supply system for an on-site, instant PFAS detection solution based on organic nano-dyes targeting specific PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances).

## Program framework and collaboration

The Go-Tech Program provides integrated support—spanning R&D, prototyping, and go-to-market activities—for up to three years, facilitating collaborations between SMEs and universities or public research institutes. Within this framework, NanoFrontier will deepen its collaboration with a Tohoku University research team and drive standardization across design, manufacturing, and quality assurance so that the technology can be delivered in a reliable, field-deployable format with continuous supply and service.

## Growing regulatory and operational need

PFAS have raised significant concerns for human health and the environment worldwide, and regulations are tightening across jurisdictions. In the United States, legally enforceable Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for several PFAS in drinking water were finalized in 2024, setting **4 ppt (parts per trillion)** for PFOA and PFOS. In Japan, policymakers have signaled plans to elevate the provisional target value for combined PFOS/PFOA (50 ng/L) to a formal drinking-water quality standard and to mandate testing and remediation under the Waterworks Act, with **April 2026** as a target start. These moves are steadily increasing high-frequency, wide-area measurement needs for municipalities and industrial sites.

## Addressing today's bottlenecks

While LC-MS/MS laboratory analysis remains the gold standard for PFAS detection, it entails burdensome sample preparation, analysis costs, lead times, specialized personnel, and logistics—making it ill-suited for frequent checks in the field. NanoFrontier addresses this gap with its proprietary organic dye nanoparticle technology: poorly water-soluble organic dyes are synthesized and converted into nanoparticles via reprecipitation, then stabilized to disperse in water. The resulting reagent develops color instantly in the presence of targeted PFAS, enabling instrument-free, visual judgment. This supports the screening density and response speed required for on-site decision-making, complements laboratory analysis, and significantly increases the number of informed decisions that can be made in the field.

## Clear division of roles: scale-up, standardization, and supply

Building on research outcomes at Tohoku University, NanoFrontier will focus the Go-Tech effort on mass production, standardization, and stable supply—ensuring a clear division of roles with academic research. Concretely, across **synthesis → reprecipitation → dispersion stabilization → drying/storage → outgoing inspection**, the company will systematize:

- **Raw-material selection guidelines**
- **Design Space definitions**
- **Process control**, including the application of Process Analytical Technology (PAT)
- **Lot-release quality specifications** (e.g., particle-size distribution, dispersion stability, residual solvent and moisture)

The initiative will move end-to-end through SOP development and issuance of inspection certificates. In parallel, NanoFrontier will establish scale-up rules in collaboration with the university team, address equipment design and maintenance, build redundancy in the supply network, and ensure traceability and regulatory compliance—all toward a robust and stable supply system.

## Priority use cases

### 1. Real-time monitoring of PFAS
Frequent checks at multiple points—water treatment plants, industrial effluent, rivers, and groundwater—make it easier to capture diurnal variation, rainfall-event impacts, and process drifts.

### 2. Optimization of removal processes
Visual feedback helps determine dosage and exchange timing for activated carbon or ion-exchange resins, balancing operating costs and performance. For equipment vendors, intuitive on-site demos strengthen proposals during sales and pre-installation evaluations.

### 3. Incoming-material screening
Simple screening at goods-in can deter inadvertent PFAS "carry-in", for example with recycled materials or byproducts spanning diverse lots.

### 4. Multi-site, wide-area observation
Beyond these, multi-site, wide-area observation in regions of concern enables municipalities and operators to identify hotspots early and act ahead of the curve.

## Call for partners

To accelerate this effort, NanoFrontier is seeking co-demonstration and application-development partners. We welcome inquiries from:

- **Water-treatment manufacturers**
- **Companies that manufacture or use PFAS**
- **PFAS removal system vendors**
- **LC-MS/MS instrument makers and distributors**
- **Municipalities and water utilities facing PFAS concerns**

Together, we aim to deliver a field-proven solution, covering data-driven optimization, hybrid operating designs with laboratory analysis, and the development of operational manuals and training programs.

## Comment from the CEO

> "We are honored to be selected for the Go-Tech Program. In close collaboration with the Tohoku University research team, NanoFrontier will tackle mass production and stable supply of organic nano-dyes head-on. We want anyone, anywhere, to confirm the presence of PFAS on the spot—and we will embed that capability as infrastructure, contributing from Sendai to the global safety of water."

## About the Go-Tech Program

Japan's **R&D Support Program for Growth-Oriented SMEs (Go-Tech Program)** provides integrated support—up to three years—for commercialization-oriented R&D, prototyping, and market development undertaken by SMEs in partnership with universities or public research institutes. In FY2022, the program unified two prior schemes—the Strategic Foundational Technology Improvement Support Program (Sapo-In) and the Commercial and Service Competitiveness Enhancement Support Program (Sabi-Sapo)—and has since operated with a stronger focus on commercialization and market implementation.
