## Accelerating Commercialization of Nanoparticle-Dispersed Cooling Fluid from Tohoku University

**NanoFrontier Co., Ltd.** (Head Office: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) has been selected for the Fukushima Tech Create acceleration program. The selected theme is "Development of Highly Efficient Liquid Immersion Cooling Fluid for AI Data Centers Using Nanoparticles from Tohoku University's Reprecipitation Method."

With the support and funding from FTC, NanoFrontier aims to rapidly advance its nanoparticle-dispersed, high-performance cooling fluid from the proof-of-concept stage to commercialization and establish a production and implementation system in the Fukushima Innovation Coast region.

### Importance and Challenges of Liquid Immersion Cooling

The increasing adoption of generative AI and large-scale GPUs has led to a surge in data center power consumption, making cooling a critical issue from both sustainability and operational cost perspectives. Liquid immersion cooling, where servers are submerged in an insulating liquid, offers superior heat transfer performance compared to air cooling and mitigates noise and dust issues. However, existing cooling fluids face performance limitations due to the thermal boundary layer formed on semiconductor surfaces, acting as a thermal resistance.

### Improving Thermal Conductivity with Nanoparticle Dispersion

NanoFrontier possesses proprietary technology to disperse highly concentrated, long-term stable nanometer-sized monodisperse particles—such as carbon-based and metal oxide nanoparticles—into flame-retardant, high-insulation base oils. This technology leverages the reprecipitation method developed over many years at Tohoku University and adapted for industrial implementation. The microscopic motion of the particles and the agitation effect of the fluid effectively weaken the thermal boundary layer, enhancing convective heat transfer. NanoFrontier is optimizing the formulations to maximize thermal conductivity while minimizing viscosity increase.

In the Fukushima Innovation Coast region, the company aims to form an ecosystem as a manufacturing and demonstration hub by combining the region's expertise in construction, instrumentation, and quality measurement.

### Seeking Joint Development Partners

NanoFrontier is actively seeking joint development partners, including:

1. Companies willing to collaborate on proof-of-concept demonstrations in data center environments, including liquid immersion cooling applications, as well as rack vendors.

2. Companies across industries aiming to improve the performance of their cooling fluids (e.g., thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, viscosity optimization) through our nanoparticle dispersion technology.

The company can provide support from formulation design and sample provision to material compatibility, corrosion, and long-term stability evaluations. Interested companies are encouraged to inquire through NanoFrontier's contact form.

## Comment from the Representative

"From Fukushima, we will realize world-class 'low-carbon data center cooling.' By combining Tohoku University's reprecipitation method with our proprietary continuous process, we will deliver a new cooling fluid that achieves **high thermal conductivity, long-term stability, and mass production capability**. With the support from FTC, we will make rapid progress, from proof-of-concept to commercialization." (Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
