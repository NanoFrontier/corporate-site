## Innovative Immersion Cooling Fluid with Proprietary Nanoparticle Dispersion Technology

**NanoFrontier Co., Ltd.** (Head Office: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) has been selected for the Fukushima Tech Create acceleration program. The selected theme is 'Development of Highly Efficient AI Data Center Immersion Cooling Fluid Using Nanoparticles from Tohoku University's Reprecipitation Method.'

With the widespread adoption of AI, power consumption at data centers is increasing, and cooling challenges are becoming increasingly important. Immersion cooling, where servers are submerged in liquid, is an excellent method, but the thermal boundary layer on semiconductor surfaces has been a challenge with existing cooling fluids.

NanoFrontier possesses a proprietary technology that improves on the reprecipitation method developed at Tohoku University, enabling the stable dispersion of nanometer-scale particles at high concentrations in a flame-retardant, highly insulating base oil for extended periods. This effectively weakens the thermal boundary layer and enhances convective heat transfer through fluid agitation while optimizing the formulation to suppress viscosity increases.

## Aiming to Establish an Ecosystem in the Fukushima Innovation Coast Region

With the support and funding from FTC, NanoFrontier will accelerate the transition of its nanoparticle-dispersed high-performance cooling fluid from the demonstration stage to commercialization. In the Fukushima Innovation Coast region, the company aims to establish an ecosystem by combining local expertise to create a manufacturing and demonstration hub.

### Seeking Co-Development Partners

NanoFrontier is seeking co-development partners among companies interested in collaborating on demonstrations involving immersion cooling and data center environments, as well as enterprises aiming to improve the performance of their proprietary cooling fluids. The company welcomes joint efforts ranging from nanoparticle dispersion formulation design to sample provision and evaluation.

## Comment from the Representative

"From Fukushima, we will realize 'low-carbon data center cooling' at a global level. By combining Tohoku University's reprecipitation method with our proprietary continuous process, we will deliver a new cooling fluid that achieves **high thermal conductivity, long-term stability, and mass production capability**. With the support from FTC, we will move forward seamlessly from demonstrations to commercialization." (Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
