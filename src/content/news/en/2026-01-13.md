## NanoFrontier Selected for J-StarX "Dual-Use Course"

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue; hereinafter "NanoFrontier") is pleased to announce its selection for the "Dual-Use Course" of J-StarX, an overseas entrepreneur development program provided by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).

This course is designed for companies aiming to commercialize dual-use technologies applicable to both military and civilian sectors. It offers business development support in the United States, mentoring by experts, and networking opportunities with defense-related agencies and investors. Through this selection, NanoFrontier will explore global expansion possibilities, particularly in the U.S. market, for multiple technology themes centered on organic nanoparticle technology.

## Background of Selection

NanoFrontier's strengths lie in its foundational technologies for precise design, high dispersion, and continuous production of organic nanoparticles. The company has been working on developing continuous production equipment for organic nanoparticles, researching and developing reagents for PFAS detection, and exploring applications in liquid immersion cooling fluids, environmental measurement materials, and energy materials. These technologies are expected to be developed as dual-use technologies applicable not only to civilian fields such as environment, energy, and industry but also to security and defense-related fields.

PFAS, in particular, has become a serious environmental issue, with groundwater contamination confirmed at over 700 bases worldwide, largely due to its long-term use as a firefighting foam (AFFF) at U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) military facilities. While AFFF is scheduled to be completely phased out by 2025, addressing existing contamination remains an urgent issue. This military-originated PFAS problem has now expanded into a social issue common to civilian and industrial sectors, including semiconductors, chemicals, manufacturing, and municipal water infrastructure.

Against this backdrop, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DoD are promoting SBIR programs targeting PFAS detection, decomposition, and neutralization technologies, with accelerated support for dual-use technologies from defense-related agencies such as AFWERX.

NanoFrontier, based on organic nanoparticle technology developed at Tohoku University, is developing a platform that enables highly sensitive and immediate detection of PFAS. This technology can be applied across various civilian uses such as water infrastructure, factory wastewater, and environmental monitoring, while also addressing environmental challenges originating from military facilities. Moving forward, the company aims to provide implementation-ready solutions that transcend military and civilian boundaries for the global environmental challenge of PFAS, with potential collaboration with international R&D programs like SBIR.

### Future Initiatives

NanoFrontier is currently utilizing multiple public support systems, including the Go-Tech program, and has secured approximately 100 million yen in cumulative subsidies. Selection for the J-StarX Dual-Use Course represents a crucial step in expanding the company's R&D achievements into broader markets and applications.

Future plans include:

- Validating business hypotheses for the U.S. market
- Organizing use cases as dual-use technology and examining intellectual property and regulatory aspects
- Seeking partners across defense, environmental, and industrial sectors

The company aims to balance solving social issues with business growth.

### CEO's Comment

"We view our selection for the J-StarX Dual-Use Course as an opportunity to demonstrate that our organic nanoparticle technology can create broader social value beyond civilian applications. Building on the R&D capabilities we've cultivated domestically, we will explore business development in a global context, including the United States, and advance technological implementation that contributes to environmental protection, security, and industrial competitiveness enhancement."
(Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
