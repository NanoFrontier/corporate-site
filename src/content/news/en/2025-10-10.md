## Approved for Overseas Expansion Support

**NanoFrontier Co., Ltd.** (Head Office: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: **Seiya Inoue**) has been selected for the **"STEP for SEED" course** under the "Sendai-Tohoku Expansion Program (abbreviated as STEP)," an overseas expansion support initiative promoted by Sendai City. The company will intensively drive business hypothesis verification and deployment in the Southeast Asian market, centered on Singapore, through expert mentoring and local networks.

## Background and Purpose

NanoFrontier's core technology is the **high dispersion of organic materials into nanoparticles** using a proprietary improved "reprecipitation method" developed at Tohoku University. The company is applying this technology across multiple domains:

- **Enhanced coolant performance** for AI data centers
- **Real-time detection of trace water pollutants**
- **Next-generation energy storage materials**

In Southeast Asia, the demand for data centers and the need to address environmental and energy-related social issues are increasing, presenting international opportunities for the company's technologies. Through this program's dispatch to Singapore, NanoFrontier aims to accelerate **localization of products and solutions** and **establish partnerships**, creating opportunities for verification directly linked to commercialization.

## Focus Areas Under the Program

Leveraging the program's support, NanoFrontier will advance its commercialization steps, focusing on the following themes:

- **Enhanced Coolants for AI Data Centers**: Improve heat transfer characteristics through nanoparticle dispersion and conduct on-site reliability evaluations.

- **Environmental Sensing**: Verify the suitability of solutions for detecting trace water pollutants and explore use cases.

- **Energy Materials**: Jointly explore and prototype applications of organic nanoparticle materials.

From pre-departure market and business practice insights to on-site meetings, site visits, and polishing English pitches in Singapore and Southeast Asia, the company will pursue a comprehensive approach, aiming to achieve results leading to **MOUs, joint research, or proof-of-concept projects**.

## Seeking Partners

With a view toward commercialization in Southeast Asia, NanoFrontier is seeking co-verification and co-creation partners in the following areas. Interested companies and organizations are welcome to inquire:

- **Data Centers, Rack Vendors, Coolant Manufacturers**: Apply nanoparticle dispersions to existing coolants, conduct evaluations on actual equipment, and pursue joint proof-of-concept projects.

- **Water Environment, Infrastructure Operators, Universities, Research Institutes**: Field demonstrations of water quality sensing solutions and joint research.

- **Energy and Battery-related Companies**: Explore applications of organic nanoparticle materials and conduct prototype evaluations.
