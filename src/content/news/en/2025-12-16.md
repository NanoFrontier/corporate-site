## NanoFrontier Selected for Miyagi Prefecture's Subsidy Program

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) has been selected for the "FY2025 New Entry and New Industry Creation Support Project Subsidy (Growth Field Entry Support Type)" implemented by Miyagi Prefecture. The company has been working on developing a continuous mass production process for nanoparticles, which has been independently improved. With this subsidy, we will further promote our efforts from research and development to the establishment of a prototype and supply system.

This technology enables particle size control and dispersion stabilization for a wide range of materials such as organic dyes, polymers, and organic catalysts, and is expected to be applied in various fields including PFAS detection materials, environmental measurement, battery materials, and the chemical industry.

## Background of Business Promotion

In the field of high-performance materials, uniformity of particle size, high dispersibility, and stable maintenance of high purity are crucial factors that determine performance and success in industrial implementation. However, the conventional batch-type nanoparticle production process had challenges in ensuring reproducibility of particle size and dispersion state due to the ease of manufacturing condition fluctuations between batches.

The "continuous (inline) manufacturing equipment" developed by NanoFrontier has the potential to achieve:

- Homogenization of solvent mixing
- Minimization of additives
- Wide applicability to organic compounds
- Standardization of manufacturing conditions

In particular, by nanoparticulating poorly water-soluble organic dyes and stabilizing their dispersion in aqueous environments, material development for rapid detection of low-concentration PFAS is progressing, raising expectations for its use in water quality monitoring.

## Seeking Joint Research Partners

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. is seeking partners for joint research, PoC, contract manufacturing, and technology licensing utilizing continuous (inline) nanoparticle manufacturing technology, primarily in high-performance materials and environmental sensing fields where reproducibility of particle size, dispersibility, and purity is required.

### For Companies and Research Institutions with These Business Needs

**■ Contaminant Detection (Environmental Sensing for PFAS, etc.)**

- Want to measure specific PFAS quickly on-site at low cost without relying on expensive analytical equipment
- Want to jointly develop reagents for low-cost, highly sensitive on-site detection of trace contaminants

**■ Storage Batteries (Electrode Materials and Additives)**

- Want to introduce large-scale storage batteries for renewable energy and power adjustment at reduced costs
- Want to domestically produce large-scale storage batteries that are less dangerous without using rare metals

**■ Cooling Liquids (for Thermal Management)**

- Want to improve cooling performance while maintaining viscosity by dispersing nanoparticles in cooling liquids
- Want to develop materials that can be mass-produced and supplied with data centers and industrial applications in mind

**■ Catalysts (Improving Reaction Efficiency and Selectivity)**

- Want to impart water solubility to water-insoluble drugs by nanoparticulating them
- Want to jointly develop anticancer drugs without side effects

## Comment from the Representative

This selection greatly advances our goal of "social implementation of high-performance nanomaterials." Particle size control, dispersion stability, and mass production reproducibility are common challenges faced by many industrial sectors, and we are very pleased to be able to tackle their solution with the support of Miyagi Prefecture.
We will establish a mass production process that can be used in various fields such as PFAS detection materials, environment, energy, and chemicals, and deliver new industrial value from Tohoku to the world.
(Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
