## NanoFrontier Selected for "J-Startup TOHOKU"

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue; hereinafter "NanoFrontier") has been selected as a 4th round company for the "J-Startup TOHOKU" startup support program jointly promoted by the Tohoku Bureau of Economy, Trade and Industry, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and Sendai City.

"J-Startup TOHOKU" is a program that selects promising startups from the Tohoku region to expand nationwide and globally, providing concentrated support through public-private collaboration. NanoFrontier was selected for this program due to its ability to implement organic nanoparticle technology based on proprietary nanoparticle technology researched for over 30 years at Tohoku University, and its potential for cross-industry business expansion starting with PFAS detection.

## Background of Selection

NanoFrontier was recognized for its clear business strategy aimed at global market expansion, starting with the PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) issue, which is facing increasing regulations worldwide.

The company is first establishing its business foundation by steadily gaining sales from potential customers, primarily existing major manufacturers and water treatment-related companies in the PFAS detection market, accumulating operational data and implementation results for reagents and detection technologies.

The PFAS detection market is expected to grow significantly to approximately $970 million by 2030 (with an average annual growth rate of over 14%). As water quality regulations are being strengthened simultaneously in various countries, particularly in Europe and North America, there is a growing cross-border demand in this field. NanoFrontier plans to gradually expand its detection targets to the water sensor market and the overall chemical sensor market, based on common technologies and business models such as high dispersion technology for organic nanoparticles, low-cost and real-time detection approaches, and PoC/joint verification models with manufacturers, municipalities, and infrastructure operators.

By initially focusing on PFAS, a globally common regulatory-driven issue, the company aims to simultaneously advance early expansion into overseas markets and business verification. In the future, it aims to develop into a contamination detection platform targeting the entire chemical sensor market (approximately $36 billion in 2030).

This clear global expansion scenario starting with PFAS and a realistic growth strategy of gradually expanding the market were among the reasons for selection in J-Startup TOHOKU.

### Future Initiatives

Through this J-Startup TOHOKU selection, NanoFrontier will focus on promoting the following:

- Accelerating research and development through co-creation with academia and companies, including Tohoku University

- Recruitment and expansion of bases starting from Miyagi Prefecture and the Tohoku region

- Promotion of PoCs and business collaborations with domestic and international municipalities and companies

- Strengthening the business foundation for global expansion

As a deep tech startup originating from Tohoku, we will contribute to the regional economy while taking on the challenge of solving global environmental and energy issues.

### CEO's Comment

"We are greatly honored to be selected for 'J-Startup TOHOKU'.

Our mission is to deliver organic nanoparticle technology cultivated at Tohoku University as a technology used in real society, not just as a laboratory achievement. We will further accelerate our challenge to implement technologies that contribute to solving social issues from Tohoku to the world."
(Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
