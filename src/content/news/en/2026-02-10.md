## Background of Selection

NanoFrontier is a deep-tech startup advancing research, development, and social implementation of PFAS detection reagents and functional materials based on organic nanoparticle technology cultivated at Tohoku University. In recent years, the company has been accelerating business expansion with an eye on overseas markets, making the development of talent capable of proactively operating in international business environments a critical management issue.

Against this backdrop, initiatives to provide young employees with early exposure to overseas practical experience and cross-cultural environments to foster a global mindset were evaluated as human resource development measures supporting corporate internationalization, leading to this selection.

### Future Initiatives

Utilizing this subsidy program, NanoFrontier will enhance international sensibility and English communication skills through overseas practical training and language/cross-cultural understanding training for young employees. This aims to strengthen the human resource foundation essential for smooth collaboration, negotiation, and joint project promotion with overseas partners.

Furthermore, the company is promoting a full-fledged entry strategy for the U.S. and Asian markets. Specifically, we will implement the following initiatives in stages:

① Expansion into the U.S. Market

- Exploring collaboration opportunities with local U.S. companies and research institutions
- Participating in various exhibitions and business matching events
- Conducting proof of concept (PoC) projects to expand applications for PFAS detection reagents and coolant materials
- Building relationships with potential local agents and sales partners

The United States is one of the world's largest science and technology markets, and NanoFrontier views it as a region where its technology and products can provide high value due to the scale and maturity of environmental regulations, infrastructure inspection industries, and pharmaceutical/chemical industries. Overseas experience and skill development for personnel are essential for strengthening the business foundation locally.

② Expansion into Asian Markets

- Creating business negotiation opportunities starting with overseas exhibition and business negotiation support projects in Hyderabad (such as BIO ASIA 2026)
- Conducting market research in rapidly growing countries such as ASEAN nations, Indonesia, and Vietnam
- Promoting joint verification and collaborative research agreements with local companies and research institutions
- Developing cross-cultural talent capable of adapting to cultural backgrounds and business customs

The Asian region is experiencing remarkable population and economic growth, with rapidly increasing needs for environmental technologies, analytical equipment, and industrial materials. As NanoFrontier possesses technological advantages that can respond to local needs, we will promote regional strategies centered on personnel developed through training to expand entry opportunities.

### Comment from the Representative

"We are very grateful to have been selected for the 'Global Mindset Development Project Subsidy.'

At our company, we believe it is important for young employees to experience international environments early on as we advance our overseas expansion. We will utilize this subsidy program to develop talent that will support future business growth through practical overseas experiences."

(Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
