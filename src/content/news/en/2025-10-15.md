## NanoFrontier Relocates Headquarters to Tohoku University's On-Campus Facility

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) announced that in October 2025, it relocated its headquarters to the Material Solutions Center (MaSC) at Tohoku University (Aoba-ku, Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture). By establishing its base within this industry-academia collaboration hub, the company will leverage its proprietary research automation pipeline (automated synthesis-evaluation-exploration loop) to further accelerate product development and commercialization centered on its nanoparticle technologies.

### Highlights of the Relocation

- **Consolidating Headquarters Functions at the Forefront of University-Born Innovation**: Seamless progression of research, prototyping, evaluation, and business collaborations within the same center.

- **Preparations for Establishing an On-Site Laboratory**: Continued precision design of nanoparticles (particle size control on the tens of nanometers scale), dispersion stabilization, and scale-up studies using the company's proprietary modified 'reprecipitation method.'

- **Full-Scale Operation of the Research Automation Pipeline**: Integration of experimental planning, synthesis, measurement, and data analysis to accelerate learning cycles, dramatically improving exploration efficiency and shortening time-to-milestones.

## Background

Through Tohoku University's proprietary modified 'reprecipitation method,' NanoFrontier has successfully achieved stable nanoparticle formation for compounds that were previously challenging. By realizing nanoparticle dispersion, miniaturization, and increased surface area, the company has enhanced material properties and unlocked new applications. With this headquarters relocation, NanoFrontier will strengthen its collaboration with the university, accelerate proof-of-concept testing, and integrate production scale-up studies, further increasing the speed of commercialization.

## Key Areas of Focus

- **Real-Time Detection of Trace Water Contaminants**: Achieving high-sensitivity sensing by nanoparticle formation and aqueous dispersion of poorly soluble organic dyes, with applications in environmental monitoring of PFAS and other substances.

- **Next-Generation Batteries**: Research and development of electrolyte systems that simultaneously achieve low cost and leakage suppression through the use of organic nanoparticles.

- **Advanced Coolant Performance**: Dispersion design to enhance heat transfer performance by leveraging the boundary-layer disruption effect while maintaining low viscosity even at high concentrations.

- **Hydrogen Carriers/Dehydrogenation Processes**: Utilizing nanocatalysts and thermal conductive fillers to reduce the required temperature and reaction time for hydrogen transport.

- **Drug Delivery**: Nanoparticle formation and solubilization of anticancer drugs and other medications to increase targeted accumulation and reduce side effects.

- **Custom Solutions**: Flexible offerings ranging from reagent development and contract manufacturing to licensing and consulting.
