Leveraging our unique reprecipitation method, developed and refined at Tohoku University for over 30 years, we will challenge the global market with multi‑field solutions using nanoparticles.

## Objectives of Participation

- Showcase Technology for Solving Social Challenges
  Our reprecipitation method can be applied across energy, environment, and healthcare fields, including pollutant detection, cost reduction in batteries with next‑generation electrolytes, high thermal‑conductivity coolants, hydrogen carriers, and carrier‑free pharmaceuticals. Through this pitch, we aim to share our technology, which contributes to solving global challenges.

- Expand Network for Overseas Expansion
  The winning company will receive benefits to support overseas expansion, and special awards from sponsoring companies will also be granted. We will take this opportunity to accelerate collaborations with global partners and investors.

- Create a Deep‑Tech Role Model from Tohoku
  As a deep‑tech startup originating from Tohoku University, we aim to become a role model demonstrating the region's technological strength and innovation potential.
