# NanoFrontier to Exhibit at "JASIS 2025," One of Asia's Largest Exhibitions for Scientific & Analytical Instruments

**Showcasing an Organic Nanoparticle Platform Based on the Reprecipitation Method—Now Accepting On-site Inquiries for Joint Research, PoC, and Contract Manufacturing**

**Sendai, Japan — August 27, 2025** — **NanoFrontier Co., Ltd.** ("NanoFrontier") today announced that it will exhibit at **JASIS 2025 (Exhibition on Cutting-edge Science & Analytical Systems & Solutions)**, to be held September 3–5, 2025 at Makuhari Messe. JASIS is a leading trade show where manufacturers of analytical and scientific instruments gather under one roof.

According to the organizers—the **Japan Analytical Instruments Manufacturers' Association (JAIMA)** and the **Japan Scientific Instruments Association (JSIA)**—**JASIS 2025** is expected to host **400+ exhibitors** and welcome **approximately 24,000 visitors**, making it one of the largest exhibitions in Asia for the science and analytics field.

## Objectives at JASIS

Building on **over 30 years of R&D at Tohoku University**, NanoFrontier provides a platform for the **fabrication, dispersion, and functionalization of organic nanoparticles** based on our proprietary **reprecipitation method**. By enabling faster, more cost-effective, and safer prototyping and validation in materials development and analysis, we aim to expand opportunities for **joint research**, **proof-of-concept (PoC)** projects, **contract manufacturing**, and **technology licensing** with research institutes and industrial partners.

## What We Will Showcase

- **Overview of the reprecipitation-method platform** and materials lineup
  (Consultations on prototyping and scale-up of organic nanoparticle dispersions/powders)
- **Application examples** in environment, energy, and life sciences
  (e.g., ultrasensitive detection of trace components, thermal-property-tunable nanofluids, candidate base materials for separation and recovery)
- **Low-cost, real-time PFAS detection**
- **One-on-one consultations** on joint research, contract manufacturing, and technology licensing
  (Advance appointment available)

*Note: Exhibit contents are subject to change. Please check details at our booth on the day.*

## Comment from the Representative Director

> "At NanoFrontier, our goal with the reprecipitation method is to **deliver the required function, in the required form, and in just the required amount—quickly**. JASIS is where the frontlines of analysis and measurement converge. We look forward to discussing real-world challenges with researchers and companies, and expanding new collaborations as a partner that supports implementations end-to-end."
