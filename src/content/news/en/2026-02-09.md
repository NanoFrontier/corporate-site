## Background of the Award

In Miyagi Prefecture, population outflow, especially among the younger generation, is a critical issue. While excellent research and talent are born in the region, there is an ongoing structure where the stage for their activities moves outside the prefecture. There is a strong expectation for the presence of companies that can challenge the world while based in the region.

NanoFrontier was founded with the aim of connecting research results from Tohoku University to social implementation and expanding from Miyagi to the global market. The growth model of creating businesses that are evaluated on a global scale while rooted in the region was a key factor in the evaluation of this contest.

## Future Initiatives

Viewing this victory as a significant milestone, NanoFrontier will proceed with further business expansion and organizational strengthening.

While based in Miyagi and Tohoku, we will promote:

- Acceleration of business development domestically and internationally
- Strengthening collaborations with universities and companies
- Recruitment and development of next-generation talent
- Creation of products and businesses from the region that are competitive globally

We aim to grow into a company that returns value created in the global market to the region while being rooted locally, supporting this positive cycle.

## Comment from the Representative

"We are deeply honored to have received first place in the Miyagi Pitch Contest. We aspire to be a company that continues to challenge the world from Miyagi. Our goal is to grow into an entity that can return the results of technologies and businesses refined in the global market to the region, leading to new industries, employment, and challenges for the next generation. And in the future, we will continue to challenge ourselves, inspired by this award, to become a company that creates global standards from Tohoku."

(Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
