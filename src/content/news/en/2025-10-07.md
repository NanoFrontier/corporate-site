## Development of Single-Phase, Electrically Insulating Immersion Cooling Fluid

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) has been awarded a research and development grant from the Mitsubishi UFJ Technology Incubation Foundation. The approved project involves developing a single-phase, electrically insulating immersion cooling fluid with uniformly dispersed nanoparticles obtained through the reprecipitation method.

In collaboration with domestic partner companies, NanoFrontier aims to commercialize a new cooling fluid that combines thermal transport performance, safety, and operational compatibility for AI servers and high heat-load equipment.

### Immersion Cooling for Data Center Energy Efficiency

With the growing adoption of generative AI, improving energy efficiency, particularly in cooling systems for data centers, has become increasingly crucial. Conventional air cooling and water cooling methods face challenges in addressing rising heat densities, prompting keen interest in single-phase immersion cooling for its potential energy savings and ease of maintenance.

NanoFrontier leverages the advantages of the reprecipitation method to form nanoparticles with a uniform size distribution, employing interface control to enhance convective heat transfer. While maintaining compatibility with existing systems, the company aims to meet requirements such as long-term stability, electrical insulation, and flame retardancy, with an eye toward compliance with international safety and insulation standards.

- Potential Applications: AI servers, GPU racks, edge enclosures, power-related equipment, and more

The product under development at NanoFrontier emphasizes the balance between thermal conductivity and fluidity, long-term dispersion stability, and compatibility with operational equipment, prioritizing ease of implementation in practical settings.

### Broadening Technology Applications

Based on its core nanoparticle technology and high-dispersion capabilities, NanoFrontier is pursuing applications beyond immersion cooling fluids, including environmental sensing, energy materials, and life sciences. The company actively promotes collaboration with research institutions and enterprises, striving to implement technologies that contribute to a sustainable and highly efficient society.

NanoFrontier is actively seeking co-development partners, including equipment manufacturers, rack vendors, and companies interested in improving the performance of their cooling fluids (optimizing thermal conductivity, specific heat, viscosity, etc.) across various industries. The company offers support from nanoparticle dispersion formulation design to sample provision, material compatibility, corrosion, and long-term stability evaluations. Interested companies are encouraged to contact NanoFrontier through their inquiry form.

## Comment from the Representative

"This grant award has enabled us to align our reprecipitation-based technology with the societal demand for energy efficiency. Through collaboration with domestic partners, we will swiftly deliver a new generation of immersion cooling fluids that combine high thermal conductivity, single-phase properties, and safety to the market, contributing to reduced power consumption in the AI era." (Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
