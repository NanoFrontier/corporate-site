## Development of Immersion Cooling Fluid Using Nanoparticle Dispersion Technology

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Sendai, Miyagi; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) has been selected for a research and development grant from the Mitsubishi UFJ Technology Development Foundation. The selected project involves the development of a single-phase, electrically insulating immersion cooling fluid with stable nanoparticle dispersion using NanoFrontier's reprecipitation method.

In collaboration with domestic partner companies, NanoFrontier aims to commercialize a new cooling fluid that combines high thermal transport performance, safety, and operational compatibility for AI servers and high-heat-load equipment.

### Benefits of Immersion Cooling

With the widespread adoption of generative AI, improving energy efficiency in data centers, particularly in the cooling domain, has become increasingly critical. Conventional air and water cooling methods may struggle to address rising heat densities, and single-phase immersion cooling is gaining attention for its energy-saving potential and ease of maintenance.

### NanoFrontier's Approach

NanoFrontier employs a reprecipitation method to form nanoparticles with a uniform particle size distribution, enhancing convective heat transfer through interface control.

While maintaining compatibility with existing equipment, the company aims to meet requirements such as long-term stability, electrical insulation, and flame retardancy, with consideration for international safety and insulation standards.

- Target Applications:
  - AI Servers
  - GPU Racks
  - Edge Enclosures
  - Power-related Equipment
  - Various High-Heat-Load Devices

The design process emphasizes the balance between thermal conductivity and fluidity, long-term dispersion stability, and compatibility with operational equipment, prioritizing ease of implementation in the field.

## Future Developments

Building upon its core nanoparticle technology and high-dispersion capabilities, NanoFrontier is pursuing applications beyond immersion cooling fluids, including environmental sensing, energy materials, and life sciences. Through active collaboration with research institutions and companies, the company aims to contribute to a sustainable and highly efficient society by implementing innovative technologies.

NanoFrontier is seeking collaborative partners, including equipment manufacturers, rack vendors, and companies across industries interested in enhancing the performance of their cooling fluids (thermal conductivity, specific heat, viscosity optimization, etc.). The company offers joint development opportunities ranging from nanoparticle dispersion formulation design to sample provision, material compatibility, corrosion, and long-term stability evaluation. Companies interested in exploring partnerships are encouraged to contact NanoFrontier through their inquiry form.

### CEO's Comment

"This grant recognition has enabled us to align our core reprecipitation and continuous process technologies with the societal demand for energy efficiency improvements. Through collaboration with domestic partners, we will bring a new generation of 'high-thermal-conductivity, single-phase, safe' immersion cooling fluids to market swiftly, contributing to reducing power loads in the AI era." (Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
