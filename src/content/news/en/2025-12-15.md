## NanoFrontier to Exhibit at nano tech 2026 and InterAqua 2026

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) will be exhibiting at "nano tech 2026", one of the world's largest comprehensive nanotechnology exhibitions, and "InterAqua 2026", a specialized water treatment solutions exhibition, both to be held in January 2026.

At these exhibitions, we will showcase our proprietary organic nanoparticle technology that enables low-cost and real-time detection of specific PFAS (such as PFOS/PFOA), focusing on new solutions that realize "on-site testing of trace PFAS in water", which has been challenging until now.

We will introduce various achievements aimed at improving the sensitivity and field implementability of PFAS measurement, based on our unique nanoparticle technology, through technical panels and reagent displays.

## Exhibition Overview

Our company provides a platform for the creation, dispersion, and functionalization of organic nanoparticles that can detect specific PFAS with high sensitivity, based on unique nanoparticle generation techniques developed at Tohoku University for over 30 years.

To address the current challenges of PFAS analysis, which has been equipment-dependent and high-cost, we are working on an integrated approach from reagent development to manufacturing processes and demo device implementation, aiming to provide faster, more affordable, and more field-friendly detection methods.

At these exhibitions, we aim to expand opportunities for joint research, Proof of Concept (PoC), contract manufacturing, and technology licensing to deliver solutions that research institutions, manufacturers, and local governments can "immediately try and easily implement" in PFAS measurement and material evaluation settings.

## Comment from the Representative Director

"PFAS is currently one of the most critical topics in the environmental field. However, rapid on-site measurement still faces challenges of high costs and dependence on specialized equipment. Our company has developed a new approach that can detect specific PFAS more easily, at lower cost, and with higher sensitivity using our proprietary organic nanoparticle technology.

At these exhibitions, we will introduce our latest achievements towards social implementation, along with technological solutions directly addressing your on-site challenges." (Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)
