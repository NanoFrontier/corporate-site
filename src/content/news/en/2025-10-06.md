## Accelerating AI-driven Nanoparticle Formation Simulation Development

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) has been selected as a participating business in the Digital Utilization and DX Promotion category of the "Startup Acceleration Support Program" implemented by Miyagi Prefecture. The theme is "The founding of a business for AI and large-scale computing infrastructure-driven nanoparticle formation simulation development."

By integrating AI and computational science with its proprietary, Tohoku University-derived "reprecipitation method" for organic nanoparticle production, the company aims to accelerate solutions that address both regional industrial challenges and societal issues while shortening the time from research to real-world implementation.

### Benefits of Nanoparticle Formation Simulation

NanoFrontier's core strength lies in its technology for converting organic materials into nanoparticles to enhance dispersion and surface area, thereby improving sensitivity and functionality. Capitalizing on this selection, the company will construct a simulation platform that leverages AI to explore the nanoparticle formation process design space and accurately predict optimal conditions for parameters such as particle size and dispersion state.

Through this initiative, NanoFrontier seeks to enable the creation of high-performance materials required in areas like environmental sensing, energy, thermal management, and medicine—making such advanced capabilities accessible to all, rather than relying on complex, costly techniques limited to a select few.

### Philosophy of a Tohoku University–born Deep Tech Startup

As a deep tech startup born out of Tohoku University, NanoFrontier's corporate philosophy emphasizes identifying technologies that society needs, then swiftly commercializing them through collaborations with local business organizations, industry partners, research institutions like Tohoku University, and others.

By providing simple, low-cost technologies accessible to all, the company strives to contribute to realizing a sustainable society that leaves no one behind.

## Comment from the Representative

"This support will enable us to further advance our efforts to implement AI and computational science in manufacturing. By deepening industry-academia-government collaboration and enhancing the speed and reproducibility of our R&D, we will continuously deliver 'usable' nanoparticle technologies that prove valuable in the field." (Representative Director Seiya Inoue)

## About the "Miyagi Startup Acceleration Support Program"

This program, administered by the Miyagi Industrial Promotion Organization, aims to create employment opportunities and revitalize local industries by supporting startups that contribute to solving regional challenges. In collaboration with chambers of commerce and industry across Miyagi Prefecture, the program provides assistance to new businesses.

The Digital Utilization and DX Promotion category targets pioneering startups that leverage advanced digital technologies such as IT, IoT, AI, robotics, and RPA to address challenges in areas like disaster prevention and mitigation, education, childcare, healthcare, welfare, social participation, primary industries, tourism, economic development, environment, energy, and social infrastructure.

The program is open to entrepreneurs relocating from outside the prefecture, returnees from major cities, business succession-based startups, and women-led ventures—promoting balanced economic, social, and environmental development in line with the principles of the SDGs.
