## Integration of AI and Nanoparticle Generation Simulation Development

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) has been selected as a target company under the Digital Utilization and DX Promotion category of the 'Startup Acceleration Support Program' implemented by Miyagi Prefecture. The theme is 'Founding a Business in Nanoparticle Generation Simulation Development Using AI and Large-Scale Computing Infrastructure.'

By integrating AI and computational science with the proprietary 'reprecipitation method' organic nanoparticle technology originating from Tohoku University, NanoFrontier aims to accelerate the process from research to social implementation, providing solutions that contribute to both industrial and social challenges in the region.

## AI Exploration of Nanoparticle Generation Processes and Creation of High-Performance Materials

NanoFrontier's core strength lies in its nanoparticle technology that enhances the dispersibility and surface area of organic materials, thereby improving their sensitivity and functionality. With this selection, the company will use AI to explore the design space of nanoparticle generation processes and construct a high-precision simulation platform to optimize conditions such as particle size and dispersion state.

Through this initiative, NanoFrontier aims to provide high-performance materials required in fields such as environmental sensing, energy, thermal management, and healthcareâ€”without relying on expensive and complex technologies accessible only to a limited number of experts. The goal is to make these materials accessible to everyone.

### Comment from the Representative

"With this support, we can further advance our efforts to implement AI and computational science in manufacturing. By deepening industry-academia-government collaboration and improving the speed and reproducibility of research and development, we will continue to deliver 'usable' nanoparticle technologies that are practical in the field." (Seiya Inoue, Representative Director)

## About the Miyagi Prefecture Startup Acceleration Support Program
