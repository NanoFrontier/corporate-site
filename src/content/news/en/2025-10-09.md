## Accelerating Global Expansion through Participation in 'Meet Taipei 2025'

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) has been selected for the 'Startup City Global Challenge Program' promoted by Sendai City. The company will exhibit at 'Meet Taipei 2025,' a startup exhibition and business-matching event held in Taiwan, from the Sendai City booth. Under this program, NanoFrontier will receive support to drive global expansion, including on-site business negotiations and matchmaking support, as well as opportunities to engage with ecosystem stakeholders. The goal is to create collaborative relationships with overseas companies, investors, and research institutions.

### Exhibition Overview

NanoFrontier has built a platform that offers comprehensive services for the production, dispersion, and functionalization of organic nanoparticles, based on the unique 'reprecipitation method' honed over more than 30 years at Tohoku University. At Meet Taipei, the company will introduce industry-ready products and services centered around the following themes:

- Nano-fluids for immersion cooling, addressing thermal challenges in AI data centers
- Reagents and sensor materials for rapid, low-cost detection of trace components like PFAS
- Contract manufacturing and technology licensing, covering the entire journey from research prototypes to mass production

At the booth, NanoFrontier will provide easy-to-understand explanations of the reprecipitation method's features, its material lineup, and application examples. The company will also welcome individual technical consultations and discussions on potential joint research and proof-of-concept (PoC) collaborations.

### Comment from the Representative Director

"NanoFrontier aims to bridge the gap between research and implementation by rapidly delivering optimal nanoparticle designs. At Meet Taipei, we will deepen collaborations with leading Taiwanese and Asian companies and researchers, focusing on real-world challenges to accelerate global partnerships."
