## NanoFrontier Selected for Startup City Global Challenge Program

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd. (Head Office: Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture; Representative Director: Seiya Inoue) has been selected for the 'Startup City Global Challenge Program' promoted by Sendai City, and will exhibit at the 'Meet Taipei 2025' startup exhibition and business matching event from Sendai City's booth.

## Purpose and Expectations of the Exhibition

Our company has built a platform that provides an integrated offering for the production, dispersion, and functionalization of organic nanoparticles, based on the proprietary 'reprecipitation method' refined over more than 30 years at Tohoku University. At Meet Taipei, we plan to introduce topics directly linked to industrial implementation, including:

- Nanofluids for immersion cooling to address heat challenges in AI data centers
- Reagents and sensor materials for rapid, low-cost detection of trace components such as PFAS
- Contract manufacturing and technology licensing, from research prototypes to mass production

At the booth, we will provide easy-to-understand explanations of the features of the reprecipitation method, our material lineup, and application examples. We also plan to accept individual technical consultations and discussions regarding joint research and Proof of Concept (PoC) projects.

Through this program and our exhibition activities during the event, we aim to accelerate the formation of partnerships in major Asian markets such as materials, electronics, environmental monitoring, and data centers. This will enable us to shorten lead times from research to social implementation and optimize costs.

### Planned Exhibition and Introduction Contents

- Overview of the reprecipitation platform and material lineup (dispersions/powders, prototype to mass production consultation)
- Application examples for data center cooling, environment/energy, and life sciences
- Individual consultations on joint research, contract manufacturing, and technology licensing (advance reservations available)

*Please note that exhibition contents are subject to change without notice. Please check the booth during the event for the latest details.*
