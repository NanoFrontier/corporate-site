The "3rd Tohoku Tech Plan Grand Prix" was held with a focus on the six Tohoku prefectures (Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Akita, Yamagata, and Fukushima), aiming to connect the region's natural resources, research results, and technological potential to industry. As part of the "TOHOKU TECH PLANTER" platform, which supports teams trying to change the world from Tohoku with science, technology, and passion, 12 selected finalist teams presented their business plans for solving social issues.

## Presentation Theme

NanoFrontier Co., Ltd., a Tohoku University startup, has developed a proprietary technology that can generate nanoparticles at low cost and high purity based on the "reprecipitation method," which has been researched in the pharmaceutical field for over 30 years. As data center power consumption has increased to about 1/10 of the world's power generation due to the spread of AI and LLMs, the company is advancing the practical application of next-generation nano-cooling liquids using nanoparticles.

In conventional immersion cooling, there was a challenge of reduced heat transfer due to the "thermal boundary layer" formed on the cooling surface. NanoFrontier's nano-cooling liquid destroys this boundary film with nanoparticles, significantly improving thermal conductivity without compromising fluidity, thereby enhancing the cooling efficiency of AI servers and contributing to power reduction in data centers.

Furthermore, the company has developed particle generation simulations combining AI and large-scale calculations to streamline wet experiments. The generated nanoparticles have potential applications in various fields beyond cooling liquids, including batteries, catalysts, environmental pollution detection, and pharmaceuticals.

## Seeking Joint Research and Partners

NanoFrontier is seeking partners for joint research, PoC, contract manufacturing, and technology licensing in the following areas:

- Environmental sensing (detection of specific pollutants such as PFAS, etc.)
- Next-generation battery and electrolyte development
- Thermal management with data center and rack operators (high thermal conductivity cooling liquids)
- Chemical process optimization and nanoparticle mass production technology

We will actively promote demonstration and social implementation through industry-academia-government collaboration towards realizing a sustainable society.

## Comment from Co-founder Katsuya Saito

> "We are deeply honored to receive this recognition. At NanoFrontier, we are tackling energy challenges with nanoparticle technology based on the reprecipitation method developed at Tohoku University. It is a great encouragement that we can challenge major issues facing society, such as power problems associated with AI proliferation, from Tohoku. With this award as a catalyst, we will further accelerate technology development and social implementation to contribute to realizing a sustainable future."
